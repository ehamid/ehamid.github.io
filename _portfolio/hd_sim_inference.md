In this project we developed methods for constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for the linear component of high-dimensional single-index models.

The code for experiments in the paper is available on github: [https://github.com/ehamid/sim_debiasing](https://github.com/ehamid/sim_debiasing)
