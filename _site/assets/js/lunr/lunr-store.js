Single-index models generalize linear models by allowing the reponse $ y $ to depend on a non-linear function of a linear combination of the predictors:...","categories": [],

Abstract: We develop an algorithm to train individually fair learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The proposed approach ensures items from minority groups appear alongside similar items from majority groups. This...","categories": [],
